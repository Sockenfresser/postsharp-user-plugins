With these aspects you can add powerful logging to your applications without the effort, complexity or clutter of writing procedural logging code.  Plus, Gibraltar makes it incredibly easy to manage and analyze your logs.

<table>
<tr><td>*Attribute*</td><td>*Description*</td></tr>
<tr><td>`[GTrace]`</td><td>logs entry and exit from tagged methods including appropriate message indentation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>`[GTraceField]`</td><td>logs every change in value of a tagged field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>`[GException]`</td><td>logs exceptions at the point they are raised. This is a handy safe guard to ensure that both handled and unhandled exceptions are logged by Gibraltar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>`[GTimer]`</td><td>lets you graph method execution time in Gibraltar providing invaluable information to identify bottlenecks and optimize performance.</td></tr>
